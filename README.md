### Design Choices
The design takes heavy inspiration from the minimalist, avant-garde aesthetic of Station to Station's album cover. This is reflected in the typography, color palette, layout, and overall mood of the website. The result is a modern, immersive site that pays homage to David Bowie's bold and innovative artistic identity.

#### Colors
- Primary Colors:
  - White for backgrounds to evoke the album's clean and modern feel.
  - Light red for backgrounds for reviews
  - Light blue for backgrounds for comments
  - Black for bold contrasts in typography.
  - Deep Red accents inspired by the subtle use of red tones in the album's design.

  The choice of the different backgropund colors for different sections is aimed at creating clear visual separation and enhancing the userâ€™s ability to navigate and understand the content.


#### Typography
**Font:** The primary typeface mimics the stark, geometric sans-serif typography used on Station to Station. The font used is Bricolage Grotesque. For longer texts like description etc, Courier New is used.
**Text Styling:** All text elements, except for longer texts like descriptitions etc, feature uppercase letters with a condensed spacing, creating a compact and impactful visual.
**Word Merging:** Inspired by the album cover on Station to Station, words are presented without spaces, creating a unified, continuous text flow (e.g., StationtoStation, DavidBowieAlbums). UTVECKLA navbar album titlar etc

[Station to Station - Back cover](https://www.discogs.com/master/22420-David-Bowie-Station-To-Station/image/SW1hZ2U6OTU4Nzk1Mg==)


#### Imagery and icons
Since the albums are central, album covers are used on all pages. In addition to album covers and a login page image, no other images are used.

Icons are frequently used on the website. They are used partly on the album page to symbolize functions such as "View reviews," "Add to favorites albums," and "Show description." Some icons have a number next to them indicating the number of reviews or comments. To make it clearer for the user what the icons mean, a tooltip is displayed when the user hovers over the icon with the mouse. Some icons and buttons are only shown when the user is logged in.

## Known Bugs

## Deployment

### Heroku

This project is deployed on Heroku, a cloud platform service that enables easy deployment and scaling for web applications. The deployment process includes the following steps:

#### Initial Setup

1. **Create a Heroku Account**: Sign up for a Heroku account at [Heroku's website](https://www.heroku.com/).
2. **Install Heroku CLI**: Download and install the Heroku Command Line Interface (CLI) to interact with Heroku from your local machine.

#### Preparing the Application

1. **Procfile**: Create a `Procfile` in your project root directory. This file tells Heroku how to run your application.
2. **Requirements.txt**: Ensure you have a `requirements.txt` file listing all project dependencies.
3. **Config Vars**: Set up necessary configuration variables in Heroku (like `SECRET_KEY`, database URL, etc.).

#### Deployment

1. **Create a Heroku App**: Use the Heroku CLI to create a new app.
2. **Add Buildpacks**: If necessary, add the correct buildpacks via the Heroku dashboard or CLI.
3. **Deploy**: Push your code to Heroku either by connecting your GitHub repository to Heroku or using the Heroku CLI to deploy your application.
4. **Database Migration (if applicable)**: Run database migrations using the Heroku CLI.

#### Final Steps

1. **Enable the Web Dyno**: Make sure the web dyno is up and running after deployment.
2. **Open the App**: You can open your application from the Heroku dashboard or using the CLI command `heroku open`.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

<hr>
Forking the GitHub repository allows you to make a copy of the original project on your own GitHub account, enabling you to make changes without affecting the original. Here's how to do it:

1. **Go to the Repository**: Navigate to the original repository on GitHub.
2. **Fork the Repository**: Click the 'Fork' button, located at the top right of the repository page. This creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.
3. **Clone Your Fork**: Once forked, you can clone your fork to your local machine for further development.

### Making a Local Clone

Cloning a GitHub repository creates a local copy on your machine, allowing you to sync between the two locations. Here are the steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: On the GitHub repository page, click the 'Code' button and copy the URL under 'Clone with HTTPS'.
2. **Open Terminal**: Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want the clone to be created.
3. **Clone Command**: Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 1. Press Enter to create your local clone.

The following sources and references were resorted for the creation of this website:<br>

- The lessons and tutorials provided by Code Institute, on the final module entitled "Django REST Framework" for the 'Advanced Front-End' specialization<br>

### Content

This project has greatly benefited from the educational resources and example projects provided by the Code Institute during my bootcamp. The following projects were particularly influential in shaping the development of this application:

- **Django REST Framework Example Project**: This practical example from the Code Institute served as a key reference for building Web APIs using the Django REST framework. It provided a solid foundation and template for implementing best practices in API development with Django and Python.

- **Moments Project**: Another invaluable resource from the Code Institute, the Moments project demonstrated the creation of a full-stack application with a strong emphasis on user experience aand how to use the API that was developed in the example project. Several aspects of its design and functionality were adapted and integrated into this project.
